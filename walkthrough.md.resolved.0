# Fabric Estimator App Walkthrough

I have built the Streamlit application for estimating fabric consumption from VStitcher PDF patterns.

## Files Created
- **[app.py](file:///Users/jagdishs/.gemini/antigravity/scratch/fabric-estimator/app.py)**: The main application file containing the logic to parse PDFs and the Streamlit UI.
- **[requirements.txt](file:///Users/jagdishs/.gemini/antigravity/scratch/fabric-estimator/requirements.txt)**: List of Python dependencies.
- **`run_app.sh`**: A helper script to set up the environment and run the app.

## How to Run

1. **Open Terminal** (if not already open).
2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
   ```bash
   cd /Users/jagdishs/.gemini/antigravity/scratch/fabric-estimator
   ```
3. **Run the helper script**:
   ```bash
   bash run_app.sh
   ```
   *This script will create a virtual environment, install dependencies, and launch the app.*

   **OR Manual Steps**:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

## Usage
1. The app will open in your browser.
2. Adjust the **Fabric Width** in the sidebar if needed.
3. Upload one or more **PDF files** (your VStitcher patterns).
4. The app will extract the vector paths, calculate the area, and show a table with the estimated fabric yield (including the 15% waste factor).
5. Click **Download Excel Report** to save the results.
